This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# AI-Powered UI Components Generator

This project is an AI-powered frontend UI components generator that leverages Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and several AI technologies to dynamically generate and edit UI components based on user input.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI Component Generation**: Generate UI components based on user inputs.
- **Ace Code Editor Integration**: Edit generated code snippets directly in the browser.
- **CopilotKit Integration**: Utilize AI to enhance component generation and provide implementation tutorials.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building user interfaces with server-side rendering and static generation capabilities.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **OpenAI API (GPT-4)**: Utilizes GPT-4 for generating accurate and context-aware code snippets.
- **Langchain**: Provides AI capabilities to search the web and integrate knowledge directly into applications.
- **CopilotKit**: An open-source framework for building custom AI copilots and in-app agents.
- **Ace Code Editor**: Embeddable code editor that provides syntax highlighting and code editing features.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of React or Next.js

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>
npm install


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
